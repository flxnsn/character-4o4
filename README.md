# character-4o4

This is an example repository for learning purposes.
The repository is designed as a creative writing exercise, cataloging information about a fictional character which I named "4o4".
As required per task, this readme will now feature a short introduction to said character:

4o4

This concludes this short but still comprehensive first impression, and this readme.

More information can also be found under [this](https://www.google.com/search/4o4) google search.
