# The vast chronicles of 4o4's existence

## Account 1

In 1898, in Southampton, UK, a three-story house caught fire. Most residents made it out before the fire consumed the foundations, but an elderly man got trapped by the flames, eventually making his way onto the roof. Facing a horrible end, desperation drove him to leap off the building, but happenstance saw a carriage of a nearby fabric store traversing the street below in that very moment. Against all odds, the man landed within an order of the finest linen of southern england, and survived with only minor injuries. He lived for 14 more years before opting for a relaxing retreat aboard the ocean liner "HMS Titanic".
The involvement of 4o4 in these events is still disputed.

## Account 2

Philosophically speaking, there is one proof of 4o4's existence, hidden within the lines of this very repository. As a result of the subjective nature of our perception of the world through the famously unreliable lens that is our consciousness, the ultimate proof of an objective reality remains impossible. Truth cannot be a tangible thing, but merely a logical deduction, therefore manifesting 4o4 as an idea within this writing is arguably equivalent to all other things we might describe as real, even with no further information provided.

## Account 3

The ultimate story about 4o4 would have been an empty field, a true void of data rather than a meandering telling that arrives at the same absence of satisfaction. But I want to waste the readers' time. It would not be fair to shelter them from such frustration when I was made to conceive of all of this in the first place. And are stories not made to feel, feel strongly even? That sure should be the destination, the goal of any writing exercise.
It always has to be the end that draws the most emotion, a climax of frustration proving that there was, indeed, no point to any of this. I strive to align the reader with my state of mind while writing this, tempting them to sink their first into the pixels on the screen: A desperate attempt to harm those words that are costing them their valuable waking hours. That is why in this story and so many more this last sentence is called a punch line.
